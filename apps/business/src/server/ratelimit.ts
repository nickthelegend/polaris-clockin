/**
 * Token buckets, in memory, per key (an IP, an API key, a signing account).
 *
 * The relayer pays gas for every request it accepts, so it must not be a free
 * faucet for spam: each bucket refills at `perMinute` and holds at most
 * `burst`. Per-process: behind several instances the effective limit is
 * multiplied, which is acceptable for abuse control (money is protected by
 * signatures, not by this).
 *
 * At most MAX_BUCKETS keys are kept. When a new key would exceed that, the
 * least recently used bucket is dropped (a Map iterates in insertion order,
 * and every use moves its key to the end), so churning through fresh keys
 * can only ever evict idle buckets, never reset everyone's.
