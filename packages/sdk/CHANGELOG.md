# Changelog

## 0.3.0

Polaris on Monad, with Stripe's ergonomics.

### Added

- **`polarispay-sdk/server`**: `createPolarisServer({ secretKey, baseUrl })` with
  `checkout.sessions.create(params, { idempotencyKey })` and
  `checkout.sessions.retrieve(id)`. Parameters are validated locally; requests
  retry on network errors, 429 and 5xx with backoff and `Retry-After`, always
  under an idempotency key. Refuses publishable keys, plain http off localhost,
  and running in a browser.
- **Webhooks**: `webhooks.verify(rawBody, signatureHeader, secret)` (and
  `verifyAsync`, `generateTestHeader`), Stripe-style `t=…,v1=…` HMAC-SHA256
  signatures over `${t}.${body}` with a 300 s tolerance either way, several
  `v1` values during secret rotation, and typed events for all nine types:
  `payment.succeeded`, `plan.opened`, `installment.collected`,
  `installment.failed`, `plan.completed`, `plan.liquidated`,
  `subscription.charged`, `subscription.canceled`, `payout.paid`. Synchronous
  on every runtime: Node's crypto when present, a tested pure-JS HMAC otherwise.
- **Hosted checkout** from the browser: `createPolaris({ publishableKey })`
  with `openCheckout` (a centred popup with a page overlay on desktop, a
  redirect on phones or when the popup is blocked, results by origin-checked
  `postMessage`, close and timeout handling, and a popup that opens inside the
  click even while your server creates the session) and `redirectToCheckout`.
- **Direct pay on Monad**: `pay({ merchant, amount, orderId })` with any
  EIP-1193 provider through `PolarisPayments.payWithAuthorization`. One ERC-3009
  signature, the domain read from the token, the signer checked before sending,
  gasless through a relayer when `relayUrl` is set. `getPayment` reads the
  on-chain record.
- **Chain presets** `MONAD_TESTNET` and `MONAD`, with addresses generated from
  `packages/contracts/deployments` into `src/deployments.ts`. Undeployed
  contracts are the zero address and refused at runtime with
  `contract_not_deployed`.
- **React**: `PolarisCheckoutButton`, `PolarisMessaging` (the product-page
  "or 4 payments of $50.38 with Polaris" line and its Learn more popover),
  `PolarisPayButton`, `usePolarisCheckout`, `PolarisProvider` and
  `PolarisMark`. CSS-variable theming with no stylesheet to import,
  server-rendered, accessible.
- `quotePayIn4` / `polaris.quote`: Pay in 4 priced and scheduled exactly as
  the loan engine does it (10% APR pro-rated; $200 is 4 × $50.38). Instalments
  follow `PolarisLoanEngine.thresholdFor`'s rounded-up ladder, unit for unit,
  and fall due at `(i + 1) × interval`: nothing is paid at checkout, and the
  first payment is a week later.

### Changed

- `createPolaris` targets Monad when given a publishableKey (test keys: Monad
  testnet, live keys: Monad). `pay()` on Monad is a signature, not
  approve-then-pay.
- ethers is loaded lazily, only when a wallet method runs.
- Wallet errors name the chain's gas token instead of always saying ETH, and
  results include the original error as `cause`.

### Compatibility

- With neither a publishableKey nor a chain, `createPolaris()` still targets
  the 0.2 Sepolia deployment (with a one-time warning). This fallback will be
  removed in 0.4.
- `contracts` still works as an alias of `chain`; `SEPOLIA`,
  `PayWithPolarisBNPL`, `POLARIS_SEPOLIA` and the 0.2 wallet methods
  (`subscribe`, `payLater`, `getCredit`, …) are unchanged.

### Fixed

- `PayWithPolarisBNPL` listed the first instalment as due "Today" while
  saying nothing is taken today. Its schedule now starts one interval after
  checkout, as the loan engine collects it.
- `quotePayIn4`'s displayed instalments could miss the displayed total by a
  cent or more ($189 at 10%: 4 × 47.61 against 190.45). They are now the steps
  of the running total rounded to the cent, so they always add up to it.
- A buyer on the wrong network who declined the switch (or declined adding
  Monad) was told "You cancelled the request." `pay()` and the 0.2 flows now
  answer "Switch your wallet to Monad Testnet to pay." with a `wrong_chain`
  `PolarisError` as `cause`, and never ask for a signature.

## 0.2.1

- Split the React widget into `polarispay-sdk/react` so React is optional.
