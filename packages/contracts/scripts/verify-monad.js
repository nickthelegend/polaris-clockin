/**
 * Verify every contract in deployments/monad-testnet.json on Monadscan, through
 * the Etherscan V2 API (Monad testnet, chainid 10143, is on its free tier).
 *
 *   ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=... pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts verify:monad
 *   VERIFY_DRY_RUN=1 pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts verify:monad    # no key: which sources and arguments reproduce each contract
 *   VERIFY_ONLY=PolarisCheckout,GuardianReceiver ...                     # submit only some of them
 *
 * The contracts: every one the record lists, and every one a redeploy
 * replaced (still on chain under its old address, so still worth reading).
 * For each (lib/verify.js):
 *
 *   - the sources that built it: today's when they reproduce the code on
 *     chain, else those of the commit the record names for it
 *     (`sourceCommit`, per contract, per replaced contract, or for the whole
 *     record), rebuilt from git and checked to reproduce the code first. So a
 *     contract fixed in code since it was deployed (PolarisCheckout's
 *     reauthorize) still verifies as what is on chain;
 *   - cut down to the files it is built from, when those alone still
 *     reproduce it (what the explorer shows);
 *   - its constructor arguments, read from its creation transaction (the
 *     input past its creation code) and checked against the record's `args`;
 *
 * then submits it as standard JSON through lib/monadscan.js, which puts
 * `chainid` on every call, and waits for the answer. Already verified
 * contracts are reported and skipped. Last, it asks the explorer about every
 * contract (getsourcecode) and writes deployments/monad-testnet.verification.json.
 * Reads the chain; sends no transaction.
