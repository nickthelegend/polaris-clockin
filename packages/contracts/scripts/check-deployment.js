/**
 * Read a deployment back from its chain and check every address and role
 * against the record. Read-only: it sends nothing and needs no key.

 *   pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts check:deployment:monad            # Monad testnet
 *   pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts check:deployment:monad -- --json  # rows as JSON
 *
 * Checks (lib/check.js): code at every contract and at Chainlink's forwarder;
 * the deployer owns what it should; PolarisCheckout is the loan engine's only
 * originator and the payments' checkout; the scores, the vault and the
 * registry are wired; GuardianReceiver is the checkout's credit guard with
 * the recorded thresholds; the three CRE receivers sit behind the recorded
 * forwarder with the recorded simulation transmitter (never the deployer);
 * the relayer's operator roles; PolarisSplit's token and domain, when the
 * deployment has one; the dollar's EIP-712 domain (and, for the
 * mock, that it says it is one); the demo merchant. Exit 1 if any fails.
