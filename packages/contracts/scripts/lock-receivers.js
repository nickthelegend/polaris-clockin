/**
 * Lock the CRE receivers on Monad testnet to the deployed Polaris workflows:
 *
 *   CRE_WORKFLOW_OWNER=0x… \
 *   CRE_WORKFLOW_ID_COLLECTIONS=0x… CRE_WORKFLOW_ID_UNDERWRITE=0x… CRE_WORKFLOW_ID_GUARDIAN=0x… \
 *   pnpm --filter @polarispay/contracts lock-receivers:monad
 *
 * Run it after `cre workflow deploy`, which prints each workflow's id. For each
 * receiver given an id it sets, in this order and only where different:
 * setExpectedAuthor(owner), setExpectedWorkflowName(name),
 * setExpectedWorkflowId(id); then, with CRE_FORWARDER=production (the
 * default), setForwarderAddress(the KeystoneForwarder) and
 * setSimulationTransmitter(0). With CRE_FORWARDER=simulation it keeps
 * Chainlink's simulation forwarder and the transmitter guard, and only adds the
 * identity checks (for runs of `cre workflow simulate --broadcast` whose
 * metadata carries those values).
 *
 * Environment:
 *   CRE_WORKFLOW_OWNER            the workflow owner (required)
 *   CRE_WORKFLOW_ID_COLLECTIONS   polaris-collections' id  (each optional;
 *   CRE_WORKFLOW_ID_UNDERWRITE    polaris-underwrite's id   a receiver without
 *   CRE_WORKFLOW_ID_GUARDIAN      polaris-guardian's id     one is untouched)
 *   CRE_FORWARDER                 "production" (default) or "simulation"
 *   CRE_FORWARDER_ADDRESS         overrides the production forwarder (local tests)
 *
 * Writes the result into the deployment record's `cre.locked`, and each
 * workflow's `workflowId`. Refuses Monad mainnet.
