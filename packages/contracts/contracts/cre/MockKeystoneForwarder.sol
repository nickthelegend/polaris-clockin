/**
 * @title MockKeystoneForwarder
 * @notice A local stand-in for Chainlink's MockKeystoneForwarder, for the
 *         Hardhat test suite and the local end-to-end run. Never deployed to a
 *         public network: on Monad testnet the receivers point at Chainlink's
 *         own forwarders (plan Appendix A).
 *
 * @dev Written for this repo, not copied. It reproduces what matters of
 *      Chainlink's MockKeystoneForwarder 1.0.0 as documented and probed in
 *      docs/research/cre.md section 7.5:
 *        - `report` takes the same arguments as the production forwarder,
 *          checks no DON signatures, and anyone may call it;
 *        - it splits the raw report the same way: bytes [45, 109) are the
 *          metadata the receiver gets (workflow id, name, owner, report id),
 *          and bytes [109, end) are the body;
 *        - a receiver revert does not revert the transaction; it is reported
 *          as `ReportProcessed(..., result = false)`;
 *        - there is no replay guard.
 *      Like the production KeystoneForwarder it refuses a receiver that does
 *      not declare IReceiver through ERC-165.
 *
 *      Raw report layout (`KeystoneForwarder._getMetadata`):
 *        offset 0   uint8   version
 *        offset 1   bytes32 workflow execution id
 *        offset 33  uint32  timestamp
 *        offset 37  uint32  DON id
 *        offset 41  uint32  DON config version
 *        offset 45  bytes32 workflow id
 *        offset 77  bytes10 workflow name
 *        offset 87  address workflow owner
 *        offset 107 bytes2  report id
 *        offset 109 ...     body
