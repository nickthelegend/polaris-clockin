/**
 * @title CollectionsReceiver
 * @notice Receives the Chainlink CRE `polaris-collections` workflow's signed
 *         report and executes it: collect the instalments that fell due,
 *         charge the subscriptions that renewed, liquidate the plans past
 *         grace. The indexer proposes, the chain disposes.
 *
 * @dev The workflow has two triggers and one report format:
 *        - a cron (every minute): it reads candidate ids from the Envio
 *          indexer, asks `checkTasks` which of them are actionable at the last
 *          finalized block, reaches consensus across the DON, and writes one
 *          report through the KeystoneForwarder;
 *        - an EVM log trigger on `PolarisCheckout.Reauthorized(buyer, ...)`,
 *          the instant retry: a buyer whose collection was skipped for a lost
 *          allowance re-signs a permit, and the workflow asks `dueTasksFor
 *          (buyer)` which of their plans can be collected now and writes the
 *          same report for just those, seconds later instead of at the next
 *          rung of the dunning ladder.
 *      `onReport` (ReceiverTemplate) accepts a report only from the configured
 *      forwarder and, once set, only from the expected workflow owner, name
 *      and id; while `simulationTransmitter` is set, only from that origin
 *      (PolarisReceiver).
 *
 *      Report body (after the forwarder strips the 109-byte header):
 *        abi.encode(uint8 kind, Task[] tasks)   kind == REPORT_KIND (1)
 *        Task = (uint8 action, uint256 id)
 *        action 1 = PolarisLoanEngine.collectInstallment(id)
 *        action 2 = PolarisPayments.chargeDue(id)
 *        action 3 = PolarisLoanEngine.liquidate(id)
 *
 *      Every action is permissionless on its target, because the schedule the
 *      buyer signed, not the caller, decides what moves. So this receiver adds
 *      no power: it is the DON's way of calling what anyone may call, and a
 *      forged report can do nothing a stranger could not. That is why it
 *      needs no simulation-only guard while it trusts the permissionless
 *      MockKeystoneForwarder, unlike UnderwritingReceiver.
 *
 *      Each task runs in its own try/catch. A task that reverts is skipped with
 *      its revert data in `TaskSkipped`, and the rest of the batch still runs.
 *      Those reasons feed the dunning ladder: the engine reports
 *      `InsufficientAllowance(have, need)` and `InsufficientBalance(have, need)`
 *      as distinct errors, so "sign again" and "top up" are never confused, and
 *      `NotDue` / `LoanNotActive` say a candidate was stale, which is nobody's
 *      fault. Under `cre workflow simulate` a reverted `onReport` still reads as
 *      success, so these events are also the only reliable record of what a
 *      run did.
 *
 *      One failure is not the task's: the report running out of gas. A callee
 *      that exhausts its gas leaves this frame at most 1/64 of what it had, and
 *      recording that as a skip would dun a buyer for our gas limit. So when a
 *      task fails with (almost) no gas left, the whole report reverts with
 *      `InsufficientGasForTask`, and the KeystoneForwarder may retry the
 *      transmission with a higher limit.
